Overview
--------

RC Planes communicate in real time in near-direct-line-of-sight at frequency ranges between few hundred MHz to few GHz.  

*Higher* Frequency => *Smaller* Wavelength => *Smaller* Antennae, *More* Bandwidth and *Lower* Latency **BUT** *Greater* Signal Attenuation. Linear Polarization has more attenuation than Circular Polarization but needs lower (electrical) power for similar range.  

Explorations for lightweight interface for small aerial vehicles ([IoT]).  

- Internals preferably in C/C++/Rust (pick one, and only one).  
- Microservices preferably in Golang.  

Network and Data
----------------

Monitor network. Store relative spatial location at frequencies greater than monitor frequencies to backtrack on network loss (or shutdown).
